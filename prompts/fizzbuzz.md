# FizzBuzz Function

Create a Python function called `fizzbuzz` that:

- Takes a number n as parameter
- Returns "Fizz" if n is divisible by 3
- Returns "Buzz" if n is divisible by 5
- Returns "FizzBuzz" if n is divisible by both 3 and 5
- Returns the number as string otherwise
- Has type hints and docstring

This is a classic programming challenge!
