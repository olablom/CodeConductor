## 🎉 **CONCLUSION**

**CodeConductor's Core Engine is COMPLETE and PRODUCTION-READY!**

We have successfully implemented the foundational LLM ensemble architecture that can:

- Discover and manage multiple local LLM models
- Dispatch queries in parallel with error handling
- Calculate consensus from multiple model responses
- Provide confidence scoring and disagreement detection

This provides a solid foundation for the next phases of development, where we'll integrate with Cursor, add prompt generation, and implement the full automated code generation pipeline.

**The project is on track and exceeding expectations!** 🚀
