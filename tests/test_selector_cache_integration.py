# TODO: Fix cache integration bug
# Issue: Second call to _process_request_internal misses cache and runs with empty models
#
# Current behavior:
# - First call: runs with mock models → execution_time: 0.48s, confidence: 0.124
# - Second call: cache miss → runs with empty models → execution_time: 60.05s, confidence: 0.0
#
# Expected behavior:
# - First call: cache miss, runs with models
# - Second call: cache hit, returns cached result or runs with same models
#
# Root cause: Cache key generation or model initialization path differs between calls
#
# Fix needed:
# 1. Validate cache key generation consistency
# 2. Ensure model initialization path is identical for cache miss vs hit
# 3. Write "golden path" test that confirms cache hit on second call
#
# GitHub issue: "Selector cache: second call misses cache and runs empty models"
