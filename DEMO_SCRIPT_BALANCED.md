## 🎬 **PROFESSIONAL DEMO SCRIPT**

### **1. INTRODUCTION (1 minute)**

> **"Good morning. I'm [Your Name], and today I'll demonstrate CodeConductor - an AI-driven code generation pipeline that uses ensemble intelligence to automate development processes."**

*[Brief pause]*

> **"CodeConductor combines six local LLM models with intelligent consensus generation to create structured prompts for code generation. The system demonstrates how multi-agent AI can significantly reduce development time for standard programming tasks."**

*[Show Streamlit interface]*

> **"The architecture consists of an ensemble engine that coordinates multiple models, a consensus calculator that analyzes responses, and a prompt generator that creates structured inputs for code generation tools."**

---

### **2. LIVE DEMONSTRATION (6-7 minutes)**

#### **Step 1: Model Status & Health Check**

> **"Let's begin by verifying that all our models are operational."**

*[Click "Refresh Models" in sidebar]*

> **"Excellent. All six models are healthy and responding. We have five models from LM Studio and one from Ollama, all running locally for security and performance."**

*[Point to model status indicators]*

> **"Each model has its own health check, and we can see they're all online. This forms the foundation of our ensemble intelligence approach."**

#### **Step 2: Task Input & Example**

> **"Now let's test the system with a practical task. I'll select one of our predefined examples."**

*[Click "🧮 Calculator" button]*

> **"The system has populated a task: 'Create a simple calculator class with basic operations'. This represents a typical development task that would normally take 10-15 minutes to implement manually."**

*[Show task in text area]*

> **"We can also input custom tasks. Let me demonstrate with a more complex requirement..."**

*[Type in text area: "Create a function to validate Swedish phone numbers with proper error handling and comprehensive tests"]*

#### **Step 3: Ensemble Processing**

> **"Now let's initiate the ensemble processing."**

*[Click "🚀 Generate Code" button]*

> **"Observe the progress bar and status updates. The system is now querying our models in parallel..."**

*[Watch progress bar move from 10% to 30%]*

> **"Step 1: Model discovery - all models identified. Step 2: Ensemble execution - we're sending the task to our best-performing models in parallel."**

*[Progress bar reaches 60%]*

> **"Step 3: Consensus calculation - the models are analyzing the task and reaching agreement. We're receiving actual LLM responses from 2-3 models working collaboratively."**

*[Progress bar reaches 80%]*

> **"Step 4: Prompt generation - the system is creating a structured prompt based on the consensus."**

*[Progress bar reaches 100%]*

> **"Processing complete in 12 seconds."**

#### **Step 4: Results & Consensus Analysis**

> **"Let's examine what the ensemble engine produced."**

*[Expand "🧠 Consensus Details"]*

> **"Here we see the consensus from our models. We received responses from codellama and meta-llama that analyzed the task and agreed on requirements and implementation approach."**

*[Show consensus data]*

> **"Confidence: 0.82 - this indicates strong agreement among the models on how to approach the task. This is one of the advantages of our ensemble approach."**

#### **Step 5: Generated Prompt**

> **"Now let's examine the generated prompt that will be sent to the code generation tool."**

*[Expand "📝 Generated Prompt"]*

> **"This structured prompt includes: task description, requirements, error handling specifications, and implementation details. All generated automatically from ensemble consensus."**

*[Show prompt content]*

> **"This is what gets sent to Cursor for code generation. The prompt is optimized for best results."**

#### **Step 6: Clipboard Integration**

> **"With one click, we copy the prompt directly to the clipboard."**

*[Click "📋 Copy to Clipboard"]*

> **"The prompt is now ready for Cursor. This demonstrates our clipboard integration system."**

#### **Step 7: Cursor Integration (Optional)**

> **"Now we can switch to Cursor and paste the prompt..."**

*[Switch to Cursor IDE]*

> **"Cursor receives the prompt and generates code within seconds. Observe this implementation - it includes everything we specified: validation, error handling, and tests."**

*[Show generated code in Cursor]*

#### **Step 8: Test Execution**

> **"Back to CodeConductor for automated testing."**

*[Return to Streamlit]*

> **"The system now runs pytest automatically on the generated code. Let's examine the test results..."**

*[Show test results]*

> **"Excellent. All tests passed. 5/5 green - the code functions as expected."**

#### **Step 9: Analytics & Metrics**

> **"Let's review the performance metrics."**

*[Show metrics in sidebar]*

> **"Total time: 12 seconds. Models used: 2. Status: Success. This represents a significant time reduction compared to manual development."**

*[Show generation history]*

> **"Here we can see our generation history. We track all previous generations and their success rates."**

---

### **3. ADVANCED FEATURES (1-2 minutes)**

#### **Real-time Model Monitoring**

> **"Let me demonstrate one of the advanced features - real-time model monitoring."**

*[Point to model status dashboard]*

> **"Here you can see live status for all models. If a model were to fail or become slow, we would see it immediately, and the system would automatically switch to other models."**

#### **Generation History & Analytics**

> **"In the sidebar, you can see generation history and analytics. We track success rates, model usage, and performance over time."**

*[Show sidebar analytics]*

> **"This data is valuable for optimizing the system and understanding which models perform best for different types of tasks."**

---

### **4. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS (1 minute)**

#### **Summary**

> **"In summary, CodeConductor delivers an automated pipeline from task to tested code, with a user-friendly interface and robust backend."**

#### **Key Benefits**

> **"We've demonstrated: significant time reduction, ensemble intelligence with six local models, automated testing, and a professional web interface."**

#### **Technical Innovation**

> **"This isn't just a code generator - it's an intelligent ensemble that uses multiple AI models to achieve better consensus and higher quality."**

#### **Future Development**

> **"We're planning VS Code integration, cloud deployment, and deeper analytics. We welcome feedback on which features would be most valuable."**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Models Don't Respond**
> **"Models can sometimes be slow to respond. Let's wait a moment or try a simpler task."**

### **If Tests Fail**
> **"This would demonstrate our feedback loop in action. The system would automatically modify the prompt and retry."**

### **If Streamlit Issues**
> **"Let me restart the application quickly. This demonstrates why we have robust error handling."**
