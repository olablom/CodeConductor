- [ ] Verify all 6 models show "✅ Healthy"

### **2. Task Input (30 sec)**

- [ ] Click "🧮 Calculator" button
- [ ] Show task: "Create a simple calculator class with basic operations"
- [ ] Explain: "This would take 10-15 minutes manually"

### **3. Ensemble Processing (2 min)**

- [ ] Click "🚀 Generate Code"
- [ ] Watch progress bar: 10% → 30% → 60% → 80% → 100%
- [ ] Narrate: "6 models working in parallel, reaching consensus"

### **4. Results Analysis (1 min)**

- [ ] Expand "🧠 Consensus Details"
- [ ] Show confidence score (0.82+)
- [ ] Expand "📝 Generated Prompt"
- [ ] Click "📋 Copy to Clipboard"

### **5. Success Metrics (30 sec)**
